This is a small program I wrote when first learning python. My internet was terrible and the IT people for the apartments were telling me there wasn't much to do about it. 
So, I wrote this program to get my ping to the google servers, get my download and upload speed, and see if my computer preferred a different access point randomly. 
All information is stored in different CSV files inside of the data folder. Template is added inside of the data folder on this repo.

This helped me diagnose that one of there Access points were inconsistent and would occasionally drop, causing me and many other people to lose packets when changing to another access point in the building.
